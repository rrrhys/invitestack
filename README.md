An invitation creation and personalisation app using CodeIgniter and Bootstrap 2.0

Set up notes:
You need to make a file called 'database_password.php' and drop your password in like follows:

$db['default']['password'] = 'insecure_pass';

Or you'll receive an ugly error message that the project has not deployed properly.
